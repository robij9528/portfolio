                You like your coffee a certain way, and your way is bound to be different than the way your friends like it. Because the individual tastes of  coffee drinkers around the world can be so different, there is a limitless amount of coffee products to cater to those tastes. It starts with the coffee plant and the coffee beans. Some coffee fans swear by Arabica beans and others prefer the high caffeine content of Robusta. But even at the plant level there is a ton of variation and that’s where coffee blends come in – coffee professionals mix coffee beans from different plants to come up  with exotic, gourmet and just plain tasty products.

       <h2>NEW Kenyan Blend</h2>
       <p>Kenya's high altitudes, ideal climate and strong traditions have helped put premium Kenyan coffees like this one among the world's most treasured. And as it did when we introduced it in 1971, Kenya continues to astound our expert tasters and customers alike with flavours not commonly ascribed to coffee. Bright with a juicy acidity, low wine notes and fruity flavours—ranging from black currant and blackberry to tart grapefruit—that become more pronounced as the coffee cools, Kenya is delicious served over ice and an important ingredient in our iced-coffee blends.</p>
